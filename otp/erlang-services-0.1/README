To use these services drop into the Erlang shell (erl), compile them, and call "listen."

For example, to run the echo service, you'd do the following:

== Example ==
root@localhost $ erl
Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.6 [source] [smp:2] [async-threads:0] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.6  (abort with ^G)
1> c(echo).
{ok,echo}
2> echo:listen(8888).

That's all there is to it.  You can then access the service by telnetting to the appropriate port on your local machine.
